### 🧑‍💻 Backend Dev | ☕ Tea Enthusiast | 🎬 Movie Buff | 🚞 Travel Partner

Hey, I’m **Nikhil Kshirsagar**—a backend dev by profession, a **tea enthusiast**, and a **movie buff** by heart.  
I spend my days at **BotPlus LLP**, making a **RAG chatbot** that actually understands you (well, most of the time).  

If you need **APIs built, databases handled, or cloud magic done**, hit me up! Otherwise, let’s just talk about movies and sip some chai. ☕🎬
